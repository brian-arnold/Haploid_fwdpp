# Haploid_fwdpp

Using fwdpp* C++ template library for forward-time simulations. The specific version of fwdpp used here is included as a git submodule, and all custom code necessary for simulating bacterial recombination (as opposed to eukaryotic crossover recombination) and steructure is included in the Haploid_files subdirectory.
